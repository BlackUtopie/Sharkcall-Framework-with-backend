## Welcome to the SharkCall Framework Project

![Logo SharkCall Project](https://github.com/ethsam/Sharkcall-Framework-with-backend/blob/master/sharkcall-with-backend/logo-SharkCall.png)

This framework was created primarily for internal needs in the company where I work.

Indeed there is already a multitude of frameworks, however SharkCall responds to specific needs where the existing framework was either too heavy or not very economical in production.

- SharkCall works with a simple shared hosting, no need to launch it via the terminal on a VPS or a dedicated server.
- SharkCall integrates a simple customizable backend.
- SharkCall is coded in MVC simpler and cleaner for modifications.
- SharkCall integrates an API solution, it can be used as BackEnd.
- SharkCall is very light.

Here are the advantages that pushed me to create this framework, I hope that you would have as much pleasure as me to used it.


I would especially like to thank **[Ludovic Fontaine](https://github.com/Ludovic974)**, who has been actively involved in the improvement of the framework.
